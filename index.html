    <h2 style="font-weight: lighter;">Wikipedia editing</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Pruitt began editing Wikipedia in June 2004.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-NVM-2021-2">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Brown-2016-5">[5]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-StStevens-8">[8]</a></sup> 
        His first Wikipedia article was about his great-great-grandfather,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Francisco">Peter Francisco</a>, a Portuguese-born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary War</a> hero known as the "Virginia Hercules".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Eshleman-2018-7">[7]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Harrison-2018-12">[12]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-CBS_News-2019-3">[3]</a></sup>
        His favorite article to work on is for the Pohick Church in Virginia.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Harrison-2018-12">[12]</a></sup>
        He created his current account in January 2006 while a senior at the College of William & Mary<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-NVM-2021-2">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Time-2017-9">[9]</a></sup>
        Prior to creating his current account, he had edited under several accounts for which he kept forgetting the password.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-NVM-2021-2">[2]</a></sup> Being unemployed during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2008 financial crisis</a>, Pruitt spent hours editing.
        This activity sometimes prevented him from getting job interviews when potential interviewers confused the site with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange"><abbr title="Julian Assange">Julian Assange</abbr></a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks"><abbr title="WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</abbr></a>.
        In 2015, he surpassed editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Knapp"><abbr title="Justin Knapp">Justin Knapp</abbr></a> for the most edits.
        The same year, he became an <a href="The same year, he became an administrator.[12]"><abbr title="Wikipedia Administrators">administrator</abbr></a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Harrison-2018-12">[12]</a></sup>
        By February 2019, Pruitt had made over three million edits to Wikipedia, 
        more than any other editor on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia"><abbr title="English Wikipedia">English Wikipedia</abbr></a>, 
        and he made over four million edits by February 2021. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Brown-2016-5">[5]</a></sup> 
        Pruitt has also created more than 33,000 Wikipedia articles, 
        the seventh-highest tally out of any Wikipedia editor.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-NVM-2021-2">[2]</a></sup> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia_Magazine">Northern Virginia Magazine</a>,
    </p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>Pruitt has not literally pressed the "edit" button 4.4 million times. 
      One method he has used to achieve his astonishing numbers is a software tool that 
      allows a user to make numerous identical edits simultaneously. 
      For example, he could italicize every mention of Northern Virginia magazine across Wikipedia where it currently appears in standard font. 
      Yet it is claimed he has not "cheated" his way to the top spot, since that software is also available to others.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-NVM-2021-2">[2]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
    <p>As a contributing member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Red">Women in Red WikiProject</a>,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Harrison-2018-12">[12]</a></sup>
        his Wikipedia edits have included creating articles on more than 600 women, 
        in order to counter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia">the site's gender gap</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Eshleman-2018-7">[7]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-CBS_News-2019-3">[3]</a></sup> 
        Even though the majority of his work is done alone,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Malloy-2018-6">[6]</a></sup> 
        he is also a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiProject"><abbr title="WikiProject">WikiProject</abbr></a> for Virginia. 
        Pruitt identifies as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletionism_and_inclusionism_in_Wikipedia"><abbr title="Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia">inclusionist</abbr></a>, preferring to retain articles instead of deletion.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Harrison-2018-12">[12]</a></sup> 
        He also considers himself a WikiGnome, a type of editor that makes small, behind-the-scenes edits. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Harrison-2021-1">[1]</a></sup> 
        Pruitt spends between three<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Malloy-2018-6">[6]</a></sup> and four hours daily editing, with more on the weekends. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 
        The longest Pruitt has gone without editing Wikipedia since he began is two or three weeks.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-NVM-2021-2">[2]</a></sup> 
        He made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1000000000"><abbr title="Special:Diff/1000000000">one billionth edit</abbr></a> on the English Wikipedia on January 13, 2021, to the page "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Empire_discography#DJ_6666_feat._The_Illegals"><abbr title="Alec Empire discography">Death Breathing</abbr></a>". <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
       
        <h3><strong>Interviews</strong></h3>
        <p>Pruitt was featured on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_This_Morning">CBS This Morning</a> in January 2019. In the interview, Pruitt described the first article he worked on about Francisco,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-Eshleman-2018-7">[7]</a></sup> as well as his commitment to help boost Wikipedia's coverage of notable women. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-CBS_News-2019-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Pruitt's focus on women artists, composers, and historical figures reflects his interest in shedding light on lesser-known and often overlooked subjects. He has actively contributed to addressing the gender gap on Wikipedia, recognizing that the representation of biographical articles about women has seen growth, from around 14% to the current figure of nearly 18%, due in part to his efforts and the creation of initiatives such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Red">Women in Red project</a>. He mentioned this in one of his interviews.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
